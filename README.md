# Cancer Prediction Desktop Application
Title: Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning (Synthetic Data Demonstration)

Overview:
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to cancer risk prediction tasks. Important: the current dataset is synthetic and only illustrates methodology â€” it is not suitable for clinical decision-making.

Approach:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

Results:
Gradient boosting achieved the highest performance (~92% on test set).

Ethics & Limitations

Dataset is artificial and intended purely for demonstration

No clinical deployment; project illustrates ML pipeline design

Future work: integration with verified biomedical datasets

Impact:
The project highlights the importance of explainable, reproducible ML for medicine, even at an experimental level.

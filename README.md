#Cancer Prediction Desktop Application

A desktop application that uses a PyTorch neural network to predict cancer diagnosis based on patient data. The model is trained on synthetic medical data with comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing.

Features :
GUI Interface: User-friendly desktop app built with tkinter

Machine Learning: Neural network model using PyTorch

Data Pipeline: Automated data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Analysis: Data storytelling and insights from synthetic medical records

Requirements :
tkinter

Pandas

Pytorch

Numpy

Faker

Random

Usage:
Run the application and input patient information through the GUI to get cancer prediction results based on the trained ML model.

story behind it : 
I coded this as the primary significant supervised learning project of mine
